## Introduction
Hack Ltd is an electronic consumer goods manufacturer. This season, we are collaborating with Spotify to launch a Christmas limited edition of our earbuds, called Hack Buds. Using insights from Spotify's October 2022 Top Tracks dataset, we will feature a top artist in a joint-marketing campaign. Hack Buds will combine festive designs with premium audio quality, offering a unique holiday gift for music lovers.

## Project Overview
The analysis covers Top Tracks with popularity > 90 focusing on the music features and genres, as well the most popular artist from last month. The main objective is to provide actionable insights for marketing department and product center.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- Top Tracks on Spotify in October 2022.
- Variables: `track_id`, `artists`, `album_name`, `track_name`, `popularity`, `duration_ms`, `explicit`, `danceability`, `energy`, `key`, `loudness`, `mode`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `valence`, `tempo`, `time_signature`, `track_genre`.
- Data was cleaned to remove duplicates and missing values and map the inconsistancy.
- Data was filtered and pivot to demonstrate the top tracks with popularity > 90 focusing on the music features and genres, along with the top artist with the most counts of top tracks.

## Analysis and Methodology
We used Python for data analysis, leveraging libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. Key analyses include:
- Descriptive statistics to summarize data.

## Results and Insights
